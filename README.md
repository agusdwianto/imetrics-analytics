## 🌟 The Vision
In the modern academic landscape, impact is more than just a number—it’s an energy. Our signature **Orbital Design** captures this energy through a dynamic rainbow-glow interface, ensuring your journal's metrics are as innovative as the research they represent.

## 🛠 Features
* **Dynamic Orbital Visualization:** A proprietary "Rainbow-Aura" design that symbolizes innovation and growth.
* **Real-Time Global Integration:** Automatically fetches live citation data via **OpenAlex** and **Crossref** APIs.
* **Prestige Indexing Ready:** Seamlessly displays accreditation badges for **Scopus**, **Web of Science**, **DOAJ**, and **SINTA**.
* **OJS Integration:** Lightweight and compatible with Open Journal Systems (OJS) and other scholarly publishing platforms.

## 📊 How It Works
The widget utilizes a unique **"Satellite System"** to categorize impact:
1.  **Core (Impact Score):** A normalized metric representing the overall innovation weight of the article.
2.  **Satellites (Live Orbs):** Real-time tracking of **Citations**, **Read Counts**, and **Social Shares**.

## 🚀 Installation Guide for Journal Managers
Integrating I-Metrics into your journal sidebar is simple:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/agusdwianto/imetrics-analytics.git](https://github.com/agusdwianto/imetrics-analytics.git)
    ```
2.  **Add Custom Block:** In your OJS dashboard, navigate to *Settings > Website > Plugins > Custom Block Manager*.
3.  **Embed Code:** Copy the structure from `index.html` and link the `script.js` hosted on your domain or GitHub Pages.
4.  **Auto-Detection:** The script automatically detects the **DOI** from your article metadata to populate the data.
